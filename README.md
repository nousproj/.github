# Nous — Control Plane for AI Agents

> "The mind that orchestrates minds."

Nous (Greek: mind, intellect) is an open-source AI agent orchestration system — the control plane for AI agents. It applies proven Kubernetes infrastructure patterns (declarative resources, reconciliation loops, self-healing) to AI agent management while introducing agent-specific primitives for cognitive state, semantic health evaluation, and multi-objective scheduling.

## What is Nous?
Nous is not a Kubernetes operator. It is a standalone control plane — runtime-agnostic, managing agents across ECS, Lambda, VMs, and edge devices without locking you into Kubernetes.
